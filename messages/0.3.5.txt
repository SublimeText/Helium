Update in 0.3.5
---------------

  - Scroll to the end of the result buffer on code block execution(#15).
  - Added `Hermes: Settings` command, which opens the side-by-side edit setting window.

Now we plan to rename and refactor the commands as argued in #4 (working branch is #14).
If you have any openion about it, feel free to express it in the issue.
